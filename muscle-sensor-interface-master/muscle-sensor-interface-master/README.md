A python program and web interface for viewing muscle responses from the (MyoWare Muscle Sensor)[https://www.pololu.com/product/2732]

Created by Mike Pine (mpine625) as a WMSI IDC project

## System Overview
The system is comprised of an Arduino connected to one or two MyoWare sensors, 
which sends notifications of new sensor readings over serial to a Raspberry Pi,
which in turn acts as a websocket server that can be connected to to provide
a live feed of these muscle activations on any computer.
